# Functional
Useful higher-order functions and function objects for easier functional programming in C++:  
 - constexpr version of std::invoke   
 - curry any function  
 - compose and superpose any number of functions  
 - combine existing predicates
 - inverse existing predicates
 - flip binary functions
 - match by key  
and more. Examples can be found in the tests.
