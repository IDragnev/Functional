# Functional
Useful higher-order functions and function objects for easier functional programming in C++:  
 - constexpr version of std::invoke   
 - you can curry any function  
 - you can compose and superpose any number of functions  
 - combine existing predicates   
 and more. Examples can be found in the tests.
